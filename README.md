# Algorithms methods: theory and practise. Methods

This repository presents solved exercises from course:

1. Intro: Greatest common divisor, _O_, Fibonacci
2. Divide and Conquer: quick sort, merge sort, binary search, insertion sort
3. Greedy algorithms: huffman encoding, knapsack allocation, independent set from graph-tree
4. Dynamic programming: greatest increasing subsequence, levenshtein distance, knapsack, 
minimum count coins for change, minimum _k_ multipliers for _n_
